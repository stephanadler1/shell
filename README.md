These collection of scripts is a solution for a common problem: How do I setup a new machine and get all the tools on it without manually installing all applications and customizing them. In addition it provides a way to use common shortcuts (aliases) in various command shells to invoke these tools. Secondly it creates folders for source code, package caches, symbol caches.
