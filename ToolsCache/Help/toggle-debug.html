        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p><code>toggle-debug</code></p>

        <h2 id="Description">Description</h2>
        <p>Debug logging in all scripts is controlled by the environment variable <code>_DEBUG</code> being
            set (logging is on) and not set (logging is off). This command switches between the two states
            such that subsequent commands emit logging.</p>

        <h2>Environment</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>_DEBUG</dt>
            <dd>If defined enables diagnostic output of shell scripts. All shell scripts should have
                <code>@if not defined _DEBUG echo off</code> as their first line.</dd>
